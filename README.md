# hackertyper-cmd
A terminal version of hackertyper. Inspired by https://hackertyper.net/
# usage
Put the code or file you want into the directory with `hackertyper.py`, then run:<br><br>
`python hackertyper.py yourfile.extension`<br><br>
Start randomly smashing your keyboard like a trv hvck3r V3nd3ttv pwn3r.<br><br>
However do not press `q` since that will stop the program, unless you want to!
